MagiCat was intended to be a little XR scavengar hunt around the exhibition, accompanied by a little Magical Cat. At each location, the cat would have specific animations and interact with the given environment. However, our project eventually shifted to more of a marker based animation, where the cat would play animations once the specific marker was detected.

# Implementation 

## Unity
( How things was set up in Unity )

## XR Implementation

( Initial issues leading to Zapworks )

## Animations

Animations were hand drawn using Procreate and each frame was placed together to make the final sprite sheets. They were then imported into Unity where they were spliced to make animations.

#### Example Animations

Marker images were done through Procreate as well.

# What We Learned

- WebXR is still new!
  - WebXR is still relatively new in the field of XR. A lot of people are still working and improving it.
- How to work with Unity:
  - We had low to no experience working with Unity for the first time
    - Some of us also had no experience working in C#
  - This was the first time experimenting with making and implementing animations as well
